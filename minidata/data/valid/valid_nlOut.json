This method is added to support DOM 3 XPath API. <p> This method is exactly like error(String, Object[]); except that the underlying TransformerException is  XpathStylesheetDOM3Exception (which extends TransformerException). <p> So older XPath code in Xalan is not affected by this. To older XPath code the behavior of whether error() or errorForDOM3() is called because it is always catching TransformerException objects and is oblivious to the new subclass of XPathStylesheetDOM3Exception. Older XPath code  runs as before. <p> However, newer DOM3 XPath code upon catching a TransformerException can can check if the exception is an instance of XPathStylesheetDOM3Exception and take appropriate action.

Unlinks cancelled waiter nodes from condition queue. Called only while holding lock. This is called when cancellation occurred during condition wait, and upon insertion of a new waiter when lastWaiter is seen to have been cancelled. This method is needed to avoid garbage retention in the absence of signals. So even though it may require a full traversal, it comes into play only when timeouts or cancellations occur in the absence of signals. It traverses all nodes rather than stopping at a particular target to unlink all pointers to garbage nodes without requiring many re-traversals during cancellation storms.

Note that the targeted rest-sts module has to be deployed with an AuthTargetMapping which reference an instance of the Certificate module configured to reference the client's certificate from the header specified in the AuthTargetMapping, and configured to trust the local OpenAM instance. In addition, the 'Certificate Field Used to Access User Profile' should be set to subject CN. The CN used in the test cert deployed with OpenAM, and used in this integration test, is 'test', so a subject with a uid of 'test' has to be created for account mapping to work. Likewise the published rest-sts instance must also be configured to trust the host running this test, and must be configured to reference the client's certificate in the header specified by stsClientCertHeaderName (unless the rest-sts is being consumed via two-way-tls, in which case the stsClientCertHeaderName is irrelevant, as the rest-sts will reference the client's certificate via the javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate ServletRequest attribute.

Handles all processing required to remove the provided matching rule use from the server schema, ensuring all other metadata is properly updated. Note that this method will first check to see whether the same matching rule use will be later added to the server schema with an updated definition, and if so then the removal will be ignored because the later add will be handled as a replace.  If the matching rule use will not be replaced with a new definition, then this method will ensure that there are no other schema elements that depend on the matching rule use before allowing it to be removed.

To stop the player's jump in mid air. Used when player collides with something in mid air.
Encode into a canonical string.
Report a fatal XML parsing error. <p>The default implementation throws a SAXParseException. Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error (such as collecting all of the errors into a single report): in any case, the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked, since the document is no longer reliable, and the parser may no longer report parsing events.</p>
Writes statement <code>oldStm</code> to the stream. The <code>oldStm</code> should be written entirely in terms of the callers environment, i.e. the target and all arguments should be part of the object graph being written. These expressions represent a series of "what happened" expressions which tell the output stream how to produce an object graph like the original. <p> The implementation of this method will produce a second expression to represent the same expression in an environment that will exist when the stream is read. This is achieved simply by calling <code>writeObject</code> on the target and all the arguments and building a new expression with the results.
Confirm it returns null for invalid input.

Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them, while coping with a number of issues: 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread. 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have its interrupt set. 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing the task. 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task, gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute. We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables. Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die. 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task.run throws. The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code.
Initiates a search to find a Pattern within the given bounds. The groups are filled with default values and the match of the root of the state machine is called. The state machine will hold the state of the match as it proceeds in this matcher. Matcher.from is not set here, because it is the "hard" boundary of the start of the search which anchors will set to. The from param is the "soft" boundary of the start of the search, meaning that the regex tries to match at that index but ^ won't match there. Subsequent calls to the search methods start at a new "soft" boundary which is the end of the previous match.

UpdateFunctionalityTest#testUpdate8(). Sets value of field2 to NULL
Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Returns date that is represented by a string. It uses the following representation of date. yyyy-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss based on the following definition of "dateTime" attribute in XML schema which can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime. A single lexical representation, which is a subset of the lexical representations allowed by [ISO 8601], is allowed for dateTime. This lexical representation is the [ISO 8601] extended format CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss where "CC" represents the century, "YY" the year, "MM" the month and "DD" the day, preceded by an optional leading "-" sign to indicate a negative number. If the sign is omitted, "+" is assumed. The letter "T" is the date/time separator and "hh", "mm", "ss" represent hour, minute and second respectively. Additional digits can be used to increase the precision of fractional seconds if desired i.e the format ss.ss... with any number of digits after the decimal point is supported. The fractional seconds part is optional; other parts of the lexical form are not optional. To accommodate year values greater than 9999 additional digits can be added to the left of this representation. Leading zeros are required if the year value would otherwise have fewer than four digits; otherwise they are forbidden. The year 0000 is prohibited. The CCYY field must have at least four digits, the MM, DD, SS, hh, mm and ss fields exactly two digits each (not counting fractional seconds); leading zeroes must be used if the field would otherwise have too few digits. This representation may be immediately followed by a "Z" to indicate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or, to indicate the time zone, i.e. the difference between the local time and Coordinated Universal Time, immediately followed by a sign, + or -, followed by the difference from UTC represented as hh:mm (note: the minutes part is required). See ISO 8601 Date and Time Formats ('D) for details about legal values in the various fields. If the time zone is included, both hours and minutes must be present. For example, to indicate 1:20 pm on May the 31st, 1999 for Eastern Standard Time which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), one would write: 1999-05-31T13:20:00-05:00.

<p>Authenticate the user making this request, based on the fact that no <code>login-config</code> has been defined for the container.</p> <p>This implementation means "login the user even though there is no self-contained way to establish a security Principal for that user".</p> <p>This method is called by the AuthenticatorBase super class to establish a Principal for the user BEFORE the container security constraints are examined, i.e. it is not yet known whether the user will eventually be permitted to access the requested resource. Therefore, it is necessary to always return <code>true</code> to indicate the user has not failed authentication.</p> <p>There are two cases:</p> <ul> <li>without SingleSignon: a Session instance does not yet exist and there is no <code>auth-method</code> to authenticate the user, so leave Request's Principal as null. Note: AuthenticatorBase will later examine the security constraints to determine whether the resource is accessible by a user without a security Principal and Role (i.e. unauthenticated). </li> <li>with SingleSignon: if the user has already authenticated via another container (using its own login configuration), then associate this Session with the SSOEntry so it inherits the already-established security Principal and associated Roles. Note: This particular session will become a full member of the SingleSignOnEntry Session collection and so will potentially keep the SSOE "alive", even if all the other properly authenticated Sessions expire first... until it expires too. </li> </ul>

This method is over-ridden from the AbstractTokenInterceptor super-class. The super-class implementation contains logic to prevent the invocation of the AbstractTokenInterceptor#addToken and #processToken methods when the PolicyBasedWSS4JOutInterceptor or PolicyBasedWSS4JInInterceptor are deployed, as in these cases, the interceptors set message state which prevents the AbstractTokenInterceptor from invoking the addToken and processToken methods of subclasses. This is because the PolicyBasedWSS4J*Interceptors are deployed when SecurityPolicy bindings are deployed, and the specific tokens (e.g. UNT, SAMLToken, KerberosToken) are handled by the higher-level SecurityPolicy-related tokens and binding which subsume the specific token types - e.g. the classes in the org.apache.cxf.ws.security.policy.model package, which include classes like the TransportToken, SignatureToken, etc. Over-riding the handleMessage in an AbstractTokenInterceptor sub-class appears to be a viable path for token types with  more restricted SecurityPolicy bindings, like the OpenAMSessionToken, which will support only the Transport and 'bare' bindings. Though there are several examples - e.g. the org.apache.cxf.ws.security.wss4j.SamlTokenInterceptor, which is used in the Transport, Symmetric, and Asymmetric bindings, and is a AbstractTokenInterceptor subclass. Given the documentation state of cxf and wss4j, and the complexity of the code-base, this ambiguity cannot be resolved without significant amounts of additional time. If the OpenAMSessionAssertion must be presented over the Symmetric or Asymmetric binding, then this work will be undertaken.

Code executed after the intercepted method.
Get the previous collation element in the string.  <p>This iterator iterates over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string. Because there isn't necessarily a one-to-one mapping from characters to collation elements, this doesn't mean the same thing as "return the collation element [or ordering priority] of the previous character in the string".</p> <p>This function updates the iterator's internal pointer to point to the collation element preceding the one it's currently pointing to and then returns that element, while next() returns the current element and then updates the pointer.  This means that when you change direction while iterating (i.e., call next() and then call previous(), or call previous() and then call next()), you'll get back the same element twice.</p>

<p> Returns all the data in a chunked stream in coalesced form. A chunk is followed by a CRLF. The method returns -1 as soon as a chunksize of 0 is detected.</p> <p> Trailer headers are read automcatically at the end of the stream and can be obtained with the getResponseFooters() method.</p>
Destroys the named context and removes it from the namespace. Any attributes associated with the name are also removed. Intermediate contexts are not destroyed. <p> This method is idempotent. It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context, but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist. In a federated naming system, a context from one naming system may be bound to a name in another. One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name. However, an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with NotContextException, because the foreign context is not a "subcontext" of the context in which it is bound. Instead, use unbind() to remove the binding of the foreign context. Destroying the foreign context requires that the destroySubcontext() be performed on a context from the foreign context's "native" naming system.

Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field, based on the calendar's rules. <p><em>Add rule 1</em>. The value of <code>field</code> after the call minus the value of <code>field</code> before the call is <code>amount</code>, modulo any overflow that has occurred in <code>field</code>. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.</p> <p><em>Add rule 2</em>. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after <code>field</code> is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time. <code>HOUR</code> is a smaller field than <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code>. No adjustment is made to smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system determines what fields are expected to be invariant.</p>

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions. <p> This method sets the start and end positions of the selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position must be greater than or equal to zero.  The end position must be greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or equal to the length of the text component's text. <p> If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero, it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the start position, it is reset to the start position. <p> This call is provided for backward compatibility. It is routed to a call to <code>setCaretPosition</code> followed by a call to <code>moveCaretPosition</code>. The preferred way to manage selection is by calling those methods directly.

Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field, based on the calendar's rules. <p><em>Add rule 1</em>. The value of <code>field</code> after the call minus the value of <code>field</code> before the call is <code>amount</code>, modulo any overflow that has occurred in <code>field</code>. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.</p> <p><em>Add rule 2</em>. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after <code>field</code> is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time. <code>HOUR</code> is a smaller field than <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code>. No adjustment is made to smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant.

However ssoadm doesn't include the jar that the DN class ends up in.  In order to avoid the overhead of adding a whole jar just for one function in one class, this is provided here.  Thus, this function returns true if the incoming string contains any character which LDAP requires to be quoted.

Used to create an event when nodes have been changed, inserted, or removed, identifying the path to the parent of the modified items as an array of Objects. All of the modified objects are siblings which are direct descendents (not grandchildren) of the specified parent. The positions at which the inserts, deletes, or changes occurred are specified by an array of <code>int</code>. The indexes in that array must be in order, from lowest to highest. <p> For changes, the indexes in the model correspond exactly to the indexes of items currently displayed in the UI. As a result, it is not really critical if the indexes are not in their exact order. But after multiple inserts or deletes, the items currently in the UI no longer correspond to the items in the model. It is therefore critical to specify the indexes properly for inserts and deletes. <p> For inserts, the indexes represent the <i>final</i> state of the tree, after the inserts have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in order, the most natural processing methodology is to do the inserts starting at the lowest index and working towards the highest. Accumulate a Vector of <code>Integer</code> objects that specify the insert-locations as you go, then convert the Vector to an array of <code>int</code> to create the event. When the postition-index equals zero, the node is inserted at the beginning of the list. When the position index equals the size of the list, the node is "inserted" at (appended to) the end of the list. <p> For deletes, the indexes represent the <i>initial</i> state of the tree, before the deletes have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in order, the most natural processing methodology is to use a delete-counter. Start by initializing the counter to zero and start work through the list from lowest to highest. Every time you do a delete, add the current value of the delete-counter to the index-position where the delete occurred, and append the result to a Vector of delete-locations, using <code>addElement()</code>. Then increment the delete-counter. The index positions stored in the Vector therefore reflect the effects of all previous deletes, so they represent each object's position in the initial tree. (You could also start at the highest index and working back towards the lowest, accumulating a Vector of delete-locations as you go using the <code>insertElementAt(Integer, 0)</code>.) However you produce the Vector of initial-positions, you then need to convert the Vector of <code>Integer</code> objects to an array of <code>int</code> to create the event. <p> <b>Notes:</b><ul style="list-style-type:none"> <li>Like the <code>insertNodeInto</code> method in the <code>DefaultTreeModel</code> class, <code>insertElementAt</code> appends to the <code>Vector</code> when the index matches the size of the vector. So you can use <code>insertElementAt(Integer, 0)</code> even when the vector is empty.</li> <li>To create a node changed event for the root node, specify the parent and the child indices as <code>null</code>.</li> </ul>
