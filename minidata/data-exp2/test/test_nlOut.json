format method for the g conversion character. <p/> for g format, the flag character '-', means that the output should be left justified within the field.  the default is to pad with blanks on the left.  '+' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign (+ or -).  the blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank.  if both a '+' and a ' ' are specified, the blank flag is ignored.  the '0' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks. <p/> the field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed.  the default is to add no padding.  padding is with blanks by default. <p/> the precision, if set, is the minimum number of digits to appear after the radix character. padding is with trailing 0s.

all application class methods reachable -- assume all methods of application classes are reachable.. when this option is false, the call graph is built starting at a  set of entry points, and only methods reachable from those entry  points are processed. unreachable methods will not have any call  graph edges generated out of them. setting this option to true  makes soot consider all methods of application classes to be  reachable, so call edges are generated for all of them. this  leads to a larger call graph. for program visualization  purposes, it is sometimes desirable to include edges from  unreachable methods; although these methods are unreachable in  the version being analyzed, they may become reachable if the  program is modified.

this method sends out n (for small n) multicast requests. until the last request is sent out, this method sleeps for 5 seconds after each request is sent. after the last request is sent, this method sleeps for 2 minutes to allow the responselistener time to receive and process any multicast responses sent in reply to the multicast requests. before sending a request, a new multicast request is constructed so that updates can be made to the set of service ids of the lookup services discovered due to previous requests. <p> after all requests have been sent, and the responselistener has been given the appropriate time to receive and process any multicast responses, if there are no more active instances of this thread, this method terminates (interrupts) the responselistener. note that although it is more desirable to have the responselistener set a timeout on the server socket (using setsotimeout) and then simply exit after a period of time in which both the responselistener has been idle, and there have been no active requestor threads, using setsotimeout in this way can cause random hangs on the solaris(tm) operating system.

we use the same space proxy we obtained in the session and we write another external entry, which will have a class name of 'tempqueue'. the only message consumers that can consume from a temporary destination are those created by the same connection that created the destination. any message producer can send to the temporary destination. if you close the connection that a temporary destination belongs to, the destination is closed and its contents lost. you can use temporary destinations to implement a simple request/reply mechanism. if you create a temporary destination and specify it as the value of the jmsreplyto message header field when you send a message, the consumer of the message can use the value of the jmsreplyto field as the destination to which it sends a reply and can also reference the original request by setting the jmscorrelationid header field of the reply message to the value of the jmsmessageid header field of the request.

naive side effect tester -- use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural  information is available. if naive side effect tester is set to true, busy code motion  uses the conservative side effect information provided by the  naivesideeffecttester class, even if interprocedural information  about side effects is available. the naive side effect analysis  is based solely on the information available locally about a  statement. it assumes, for example, that any method call has the  potential to write and read all instance and static fields in  the program. if naive side effect tester is set to false and  soot is in whole program mode, then busy code motion uses the  side effect information provided by the pasideeffecttester  class. pasideeffecttester uses a points-to analysis to determine  which fields and statics may be written or read by a given  statement. if whole program analysis is not performed, naive  side effect information is used regardless of the setting of  naive side effect tester.

note that the acknowledge method of message acknowledges all messages received on that messages session. message.acknowledge() method: clarify that the method applies to all consumed messages of the session. rationale for this change: a possible misinterpretation of the existing java api documentation for message.acknowledge assumed that only messages received prior to ?this? message should be acknowledged. the updated java api documentation statement emphasizes that message acknowledgment is really a session-level activity and that this message is only being used to identify the session in order to acknowledge all messages consumed by the session. the acknowledge method was placed in the message object only to enable easy access to acknowledgment capability within a message listener?s onmessage method. this change aligns the specification and java api documentation to define message.acknowledge in the same manner. method acknowledging the received messages. we iterate over all the destination names (the m_deliveries hash) and then on each messageacks vec we perform the actual write of jmsackdataentry to the space, using the info inside each ack obj. the ack obj, is an inner class wrapper that holds all the required information for a successful acknowledge.

resolving cluster schema xsl from cluster xml. using the _clustermembersstream inputstream, we parse the dom and fetch the value of the <cluster-schema-name> tag. this name is the prefix of the requested cluster xsl schema file. using this, we now go and find the cluster xsl schema. look for the requested cluster xsl schema file in the resourcebundle (classpath) under <eag home dir>/config/schemas/<reqested_schema_name>-cluster-schema.xsl. if it does no find it in the disk (the default) it looks for it in the jspaces.jar, in same path. if the requested schema file does not exist in the disk config/schemas dir.. in this case we throw exception (which does not interrupt the system load but acts as a warning) note that the <com.gs.home> must be part of the classpath, in this case.
